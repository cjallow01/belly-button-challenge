# belly-button-challenge

**Background**

In this challenge, I will be building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The Plotly D3 Javascript library was used to create some of the visualizations. These visualizations are accessed via dropdown menu.

The Demographic dropdown option includes the subject metadata persisting of ID, Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Location, Body Type (bbtype), and Frequency of Washes.

Compare OTUs on all of the samples in the bubble chart.
